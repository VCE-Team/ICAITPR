                <h2>For Authors</h2>
                <p>
                    1. At least one of the authors of every accepted paper must register for the conference as author
                    and
                    present the paper in order for it to be included in the conference proceedings of ICAITPR
                    2024.<BR><BR>

                    2. If more than one author of an accepted paper wishes to attend the conference, all such authors
                    need
                    to be registered separately by paying applicable registration fee.<BR><BR>

                    3. Additional authors (other than those who are included in the manuscript submitted for review)
                    cannot
                    be added to the camera-ready paper.<BR><BR>

                    4. Non-refundable registration fee must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted,
                    Camera-ready version of the paper and e-copyright form.<BR>
                    <BR>
                    5. Camera Ready papers must adhere to less than 30% similarity score as a whole and less than 5%
                    from a
                    single source.

                <H2>Paper Presentation Guidelines</H2>
                <p>
                    Get ready to present your paper at ICAITPR-2024. Please Create your presentation ONLY in the Paper
                    presentation <u><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn">template available here</a></u>. Please make sure that the final number
                    of
                    Slides doesn’t count
                    more than 8 (Excluding the 1st and Last Slide). A key part of the research and review process is
                    presenting and defending your work in front of peers at the conference.<br><br>

                    The first step in getting ready to present your paper is to determine what key message you want to
                    communicate to your audience. Indicon conferences are 10 minutes of Presentation followed by 2
                    Minutes of Q and A, so you will not have time to present all the details of your work. The objective
                    of your presentation is to get people interested in your work, not to explain it to them fully.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Organize your talk with these tips:
                </h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Begin by stating the purpose or goal of your research. Tell the audience why your work is
                        important.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Provide a very brief literature review. This will give the audience some context.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Move on to the main points of your own research.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Conclude by reiterating the importance of your research and emphasizing the key points.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Tips for Creating Presentation Slides</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember that your slides do not have to tell the story on their own. Slides are meant to illustrate
                    your work, not explain it entirely.

                    Use graphics where possible. Limit text to phrases and bullet points, rather than full sentences.

                    Once you have drafted your slides, record yourself practicing your talk with the slides so that you
                    can identify areas for improvement.

                    Be sure to stay within your time limit and leave time for questions from the audience.

                <h2>Poster Presentation Guidelines</h2>
                <p>
                    Posters will be on display in the Poster Area located in the Conference Venue.
                    <br><br>
                    Posters must be posted in the morning between 7:30 am to 8:00 am.
                </p>

                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One poster board is allocated to each presentation. The recommended poster size is Landscape
                        format,
                        Arch E which is 36 inches high by 48 inches wide ( 92 cm x 122 cm ).</li><br>

                    <li> Posters must be mounted using push pins</li><br>

                    <li> Each poster presenter is required to defend his/her poster during the respective poster session
                        slot
                        for the paper to be included in the conference proceedings.</li><br>

                    <li> Simply posting the pages of your written version of the proceedings paper is NOT effective and
                        thus
                        NOT acceptable for your poster.</li><br>

                    <li> The title of your poster should be done in block letters which are AT LEAST 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4
                        inches) high.</li><br>

                    <li> All text must be easily readable from a distance of 1 to 2 meters. Make the lettering at least
                        1 cm
                        high, smaller lettering will not be legible from a distance of 1 to 2 meters.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> All graphs and charts should be AT LEAST 25 X 30 cm (approximately 8.5 x 11 inches) or larger.
                    </li><br>

                    <li> It is a good idea to sequentially number your materials in the poster. This will indicate to
                        the
                        viewer a logical progression through your poster.</li><br>

                    <li> Provide an introduction (outline) and a summary or conclusion for your poster.</li><br>

                    <li> Prepare your poster carefully so that it can be used as the basis to explain and answer
                        questions
                        from the viewers.</li><br>

                    <li> It is helpful to have copies of the written version of your paper available for those viewers
                        who
                        may want to study specifics of your work in more detail.</li><br>

                    <li> Have your business cards available for those who may wish to contact you at a later date.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Bring along a tablet of blank paper that you may use for a discussion of technical details
                        relating
                        to your poster.</li><br>
                </ul>

                    2 more additional pages apart from basic 6 pages) can be added to make the final version of the
                    paper.

            <h2>Step 1: Submit the IEEE Copyright Form through EasyChair</h2>
            <p>IEEE requires that an author of every published paper sign a copyright agreement. As we add each accepted paper to the proceedings, the system will automatically send an email to each of the corresponding authors with detailed instructions on how to sign the copyright agreement through EasyChair. This form should be signed and submitted by the primary author before the camera-ready PDF is submitted.</p>
        
            <p>Please review and update all author information in EasyChair prior to submitting the Copyright form. The final author information for the proceedings will pull from EasyChair and not the final camera-ready paper itself. The IEEE Copyright Form must also match the EasyChair author demographic information exactly.</p>
        
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> By signing the IEEE copyright form, you are affirming that the material in your paper is original and you have not previously released copyright for this paper to another party. Failure to submit the IEEE copyright form by the deadline will result in an automatic withdrawal of your paper for presentation and publication.</p>
        
            <p>Review the detailed IEEE Copyright Policy <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/copyright-policy.html" style="color:blue">here</a>.</p>
        
            <h2>Step 2: Prepare your Camera-Ready (Final) Paper</h2>
            <p>Please use one of the approved templates provided by IEEE to prepare your camera-ready (final) paper for submission: <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" style="color:blue">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>.</p>
        
            <p>Camera-ready (final) papers should mandatorily address the reviewers’ comments. The 2023 INDCON Program Chairs reserve the right to reject a camera-ready (final) paper if the reviewers’ comments are not adequately addressed. The camera-ready paper should also contain all the necessary details regarding the authors and their affiliations.</p>
        
            <h2>Step 3: Verify that your camera-ready (final) paper is IEEE Xplore compliant</h2>
            <p>All papers published in the 2023 INDICON Proceedings and presented at the conference will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore®. Therefore, all camera-ready (final) paper files must adhere to the IEEE Xplore PDF specifications for compatibility.</p>
        
            <p>In order to facilitate the process of creating and verifying PDF files, we have registered for use of the tool IEEE PDF eXpress. This is a free service for IEEE conferences, allowing authors to convert their final Word or LaTeX file into an IEEE Xplore-compliant PDF - or to check PDFs that authors made themselves for IEEE Xplore-compliance.</p>
        
            <p>In order to verify that your camera-ready (final) paper is IEEE Xplore-compliant please follow the steps below:</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the IEEE PDF eXpress <a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/account/Login" style="color:blue">web site</a>.</li>
                <li>If you already have an IEEE eXpress account (either for 2023 INDICON or another conference) - log in using our Conference ID 59947X, your email address, and password.</li>
                <li>If you are a first-time user, create an account on the IEEE PDF eXpress system. To do that, click on the “New Users – Click Here” link. Enter the Conference ID 59947X, your email address, and choose a new password. Continue to enter information as prompted. You will then receive online and email confirmation of a successful account setup. You can now proceed to login to the IEEE eXpress system.</li>
                <li>For each 2023 INDICON camera-ready (final) paper that you want to process, click “Create New Title”, enter identifying text for the paper (the paper title is recommended), and then click “Submit PDF for Checking” or “Submit Source File for Conversion”. You will now be prompted to upload your file. Click “Browse” to browse to your file and then click “Upload File”.</li>
                <li>Once the checking/conversion process is completed successfully, the account holder will receive an email with the verified or converted PDF file attached to it. This approved PDF file is labeled within its document properties as being “Certified by IEEE PDF eXpress”, with an exact date and time stamp. This approved file - and not your original upload - is what you must submit to EasyChair as your camera-ready (final) paper.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> Name your camera-ready (final) file using "CR-presenting author last name-EasyChair paper ID” (ex “CR-KRISHNA-68”).</p>
        
            <p>For more detailed instructions and assistance with error messages, please refer to the “Using IEEE PDF eXpress” website <a href="https://www.pdf-express.org/frhelpnologin.asp" style="color:blue">here</a>.</p>
